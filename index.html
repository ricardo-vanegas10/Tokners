                            launch their own digital currency by simply creating a profile with media content posted as
                            Non fungible Tokens that can be owned and traded on the Tknrs network</p>

                        dependent on growing and engaging with the community and also their star power. They own

                        well as the ability to trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator
                        content with early token buyers being the biggest winners as the value of the token increases
                        with more buyers. </p>

                                We would get them on our
                                platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where
                                their digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the
                                monetary value of their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote their
                                digital currency across their channels while our native token holders benefit from the

                    <p>Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population with some countries and
                        entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds
                        holding the fort.
                        <br><br>
                        Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all aiming to fix
                        one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass
                        adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that even a
                        celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have them download an app, buy
                        into the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
                        investment as is with other crypto currency project.
                        <br><br>
                        We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail
                        investors". We are gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard to
                        understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a lot of
                        people to finally give this space a real look.
                    </p>
                    <p>A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as countries and creators would
                        be paid beyond the peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer.

                        There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home there. Like
                        Kanye said, </p>
                    <p>"Personalities would become the new currency, and services would be built on top of them". </p>
                    <p>Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like something we hope he would say.
                        <br><br>
                        Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this time there would be no dead
                        presidents on the money, there would people like you on the money, and you would own it because
                        it would make the most sense in the world.
